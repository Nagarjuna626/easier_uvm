Release Notes for Easier UVM Code Generator 2016-02-19
------------------------------------------------------

Add settings that let you replace the auto-generated bus2reg and reg2bus methods:
  adapter_generate_methods_inside_class
  adapter_generate_methods_after_class
  adapter_inc_before_class, 
  adapter_inc_inside_class, 
  adapter_inc_after_class, 

Add setting nested_config_objects, which provides the option of having the agent config objects nested within 
the top-level config object rather than being separate

Add settings for use with nested configuration objects:
  top_env_config_append_to_new
  top_env_config_generate_methods_inside_class
  top_env_config_generate_methods_after_class
  agent_config_generate_methods_inside_class
  agent_config_generate_methods_after_class
  tb_generate_run_test

Fix bug in print_structure

Add top_env_generate_run_phase

Add generate_file_header and file_header_inc



------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------

Permit
trans_var = // SystemVerilog comment
and
trans_meta = // SystemVerilog comment

Insert the agent_copy_config_vars include file only once in the case where number_of_instances > 1
This include file can copy the config vars for multiple instances of the configuration object

Add the setting dual_top, which merely creates two top-level modules rather than instantiating the test harness below the test bench

Add the setting split_transactors to support acceleration/emulation-ready environments
The term transactor means a UVM driver or monitor. split_transactors does the following:
- Forces dual_top
- The test harness (the "HDL domain") that instantiates the DUT can be synthesized onto an accelerator or emulator
- The test bench   (the "HVL domain") that instantiates the UVM environment must be untimed (no delays or clocks)
- The HDL domain now instantiates BFMs (Bus-Functional Models) that contain the synthesizable parts of the transactors
- The UVM drivers and monitors become proxies (wrappers) that make calls to the BFMs

------------------------------------------------------

Permit the / character in include filenames so that ./include can be structured into subdirectories

Eliminated the <agent>_env directory and the <agent>_env_pkg. There is now only an <agent>_pkg.

Use coverage_enable to condition the calling of sample(), not the instantiation of a subscriber for an agent

Restructured the Perl script

------------------------------------------------------

Highlights
----------

- The Code Generator can be run from the EDA Playground website

- The generator can instantiate the Syosil UVM Scoreboard along with reference models

- Now supports transaction metadata that is part of the transaction class but is not included 
in the generated do_compare, do_pack, and do_unpack methods

- Now supports a single unpacked array dimension for transaction variables

- Now supports a setting to pass arguments to the UVM command line processor


The following changes are to support UVM 1.2
--------------------------------------------

Modify compile_vcs.do and compile_ius.do scripts to use the versions of UVM-1.2 built into those tools.
(The Questasim script automatically picks up the built-in version of UVM-1.2)

Replace the variable 'factory' with a call to uvm_factory::get() to support UVM 1.2


The following changes are to support the code generator within EDA Playground (www.edaplayground.com)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add the following command line switches:
  -x dut_source_path
  -x inc_path
  -x project
  -x regmodel_file
The presence of any one of these switches causes the script to return immediately with the value of 
the corresponding setting. This feature is intended for use when running the script non-interactive mode.

Make the -r command line switch entirely optional. The script will instantiate a register model anyway
in the presence of the top_reg_block_type setting or a reg.tpl file

Make the files.f file in the DUT directory optional. If absent, the script will create a files.f 
that lists just the *.sv files in the DUT directory itself in alphabetical order.

The dut_source_path setting is now optional and defaults to dut
The inc_path setting is now optional and defaults to include
The dut_pfile setting is now optional and defaults to pinlist


Other enhancements
------------------

Add common template file settings to instantiate a reference model paired with the Syosil UVM Scoreboard,
which must be downloaded separately from www.syosil.com

The new settings are:
  syosil_scoreboard_src_path
  ref_model_input
  ref_model_output
  ref_model_compare_method
  ref_model_inc_before_class
  ref_model_inc_inside_class
  ref_model_inc_after_class

Generate do_pack and do_unpack methods in the class uvm_sequence_item.
Add a command line switch -nopack to disable the generation of do_pack/do_unpack for backward compatibility
Variables are packed in the order of the trans_var and trans_enum_var settings

Add a trans_enum_var setting to distinguish enum variables.
This is necessary when generating do_pack/do_unpack and is also used when generating convert2string

Add trans_meta and trans_enum_meta settings to distinguish metadata from regular transaction variables.
Metadata is excluded from the automatically generated do_compare, do_pack, and do_unpack methods
The setting trans_enum_meta is only relevant to convert2string since metadata does not get packed
typedefs can be given using trans_var or trans_meta, the two differing only in statement ordering.

Allow a single unpacked static array dimension in the settings trans_var, trans_meta, trans_enum_var, and trans_enum_meta
The dimension must be given as an expression [N], not as a range [N:M]
The expression can include parameter names and operators
trans_enum_var does not allow an unpacked dimension if do_pack/do_unpack are generated, otherwise it does
trans_enum_meta allows an unpacked dimension because metadata is anyway excluded from do_pack/do_unpack
Unpacked arrays are not included in the automatically generated transaction covergroup
(One or more packed array dimensions are already supported)
(Dynamic arrays are not supported)

Call the method comparer.compare_field of the comparison policy object when overriding the do_compare
method of class uvm_sequence_item in the generated code.

Format the output from convert2string as enum or %p where appropriate, and otherwise as both %h and %d.

Add a common template file setting top_default_seq_count which sets the repeat count for the top-level 
default virtual sequence (instead of hacking this value in the generated code after running the script)

Add a common template file setting uvm_cmdline which allows multiple command line arguments to be passed 
to the UVM command line processor

Move the position of certain occurrence of the _N suffix in the generated code for consistency,
e.g. changed m_${agent}_agent${suffix} to m_${agent}${suffix}_agent



------------------------------------------------------
Release Notes for Easier UVM Code Generator 2015-06-29
------------------------------------------------------

Add a switch -m <common-template-filename> to override the default filename common.tpl

Add a setting prefix= to the common template file as an alternative to the -p switch (default is top)

  The script could now be run as
    perl easier_uvm_gen.pl <template> <template> ...
  or
    perl easier_uvm_gen.pl <template> <template> ... -m <common-template>


Add the following settings to the interface template file for register access (replacing reg_access_name)
  reg_access_mode
  reg_access_map
  reg_access_block_type
  reg_access_block_instance
  
Add the following settings to the common template file for register access (replacing reg.tpl)
  top_reg_block_type
  regmodel_file
  
Make the register template file reg.tpl optional


Add a setting top_env_generate_end_of_elaboration (default yes) to the common template file


Revamp the messages printed from the easier_uvm_gen script to show the generated env/agent structure


Add a compile/run script for Aldec Riviera Pro
